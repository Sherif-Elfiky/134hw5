            Hello, my name is Sherif Elfiky and
            I am a fourth year <b>Computer Engineering</b> student at <b> UC San Diego </b> graduating in June 2026.
            I transferred from Monterey Peninsula College where I earned Associates degrees in
            Math, Physics, and Computer Science. During my time at <b> MPC </b> I worked very hard to
            earn a 3.82 GPA. I also tutored a chemistry class and saw
            students who attended my office hours scored <b>20 percent higher</b> than those
            who did not. This was a great accomplishment for me as I myself had struggled in the class
            when I took it, so it was truly a full circle experience.
